# NVIDIA BodyTracking SteamVR Driver

This is a WIP driver designed to use the NVIDIA AR SDK for camera-based body tracking.
For now, most of the code is based on the [AR SDK examples](https://github.com/NVIDIA/MAXINE-AR-SDK), and [driver_kinectV2](https://github.com/SDraw/driver_kinectV2/blob/master/driver_kinectV2)
